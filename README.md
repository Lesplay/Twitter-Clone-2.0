# Twitter-Clone-2.0 by Micha≈Ç Oleszczuk

This is a project made specifically for the CodersLab "Become a back-end developer" course.
Tried to utilise as much knowledge while using as little external (read - framework) help as possible.
It's probably an eyesore, when it comes to the front-end, but back-end seems to be working just fine - even though
much can be made better.

Tools used: PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javaScript with jQuery, MySQL.

Functionalities implemented and working:
- Can register a new user and log in using set credentials
- Adding new tweets and removing tweets
- Character count and limit for tweets
- Showing comments for tweets (with a character limit as well!)
- Sending messages between users
- A list of sent and received messages
- Settings option - a username change (visible only after relogging)
- Viewing other people's pages (with their list of tweets)

Back-end functionalities to be implemented at a later date:
- Editing tweets
- Adding and editing comments
- Settings - changing e-mail and deleting account
- Avatars for users

Front-end:
- All in all 'prettifying' the app

If you have any ideas what I could've/could do better - please, sent me a message!
